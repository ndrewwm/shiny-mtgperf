# shiny-mtgperf

This Shiny app can be used to visualize the performance of a selected *Magic: the Gathering* (MtG) deck vs. a selected opposing matchup (or matchups). It can be configured to read a static file, or easily modified to read directly from a Google sheet. I built the app to help summarize the testing data I collected during my preparation for the July 2022 Pacific Sound Battlegrounds Trios tournament. I was playing the *Modern* format, one of the most popular ways of varieties of playing MtG, and a format known for its diverse metagame.

The app can be accessed here: https://hereismyname.shinyapps.io/shiny-mtgperf/
